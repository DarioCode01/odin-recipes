    <p>Polenta is nothing more than coarsely ground cornmeal. The classic ratio is 1 part polenta to 4 parts water, but I like to measure the polenta just a little scant of a full cup. I often use chicken broth instead of water. It's a perfect base for any kind of saucy meat or mushroom ragout.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups of water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of fine salt</li>
        <li>1 cup polenta</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons of butter, divided</li>
        <li>1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, plus more for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps to make some tasty polenta!</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring water and salt to a boil in a large saucepan; pour polenta slowly into boiling water, whisking constantly until all polenta is stirred in and there are no lumps.</li>
        <p><li>Reduce heat to low and simmer, whisking often, until polenta starts to thicken, about 5 minutes. Polenta mixture should still be slightly loose. Cover and cook for 30 minutes, whisking every 5 to 6 minutes. When polenta is too thick to whisk, stir with a wooden spoon. Polenta is done when texture is creamy and the individual grains are tender.</li></p>
        <li>Turn off heat and gently stir 2 tablespoons butter into polenta until butter partially melts; mix 1/2 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese into polenta until cheese has melted. Cover and let stand 5 minutes to thicken; stir and taste for salt before transferring to a serving bowl. Top polenta with remaining 1 tablespoon butter and about 1 tablespoon freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese for garnish.</li>
    </ol>
